# CpFont 

CpFont is a precise TUI utility for uploading fonts on softwares, basically using the cp command to copy the font file to the specific software's directory.


CpFont comes to the rescue of every UNIX/LINUX user hoping that using some preinstalled program in the OS will actually make that font visible to the target program, but then fails.

#### **Simplicity is the key that makes everything work.** 

CpFont, in its simplicity, copies the font file to the program's specific directory, making everything much less stressful, more practical, and faster.

*What he asks?* You have to run it from sudo.

*What he gives back?* A lot of time of yours. 





## Installation

You can install CpFont by copying the source bash file in your /usr/bin directory;

or, if you're using a debian-based system, you can install it with dpkg or other .deb packages installer.

Example with the 1.0-beta version:

```bash
  sudo dpkg -i cpfont1.0-beta.deb
```
**Remeber: you can use CpFont only if you run it with ``` sudo ``` or as root (not recommended)**, beacuse it needs superuser permissions to copy files into the software's font directory.

You're ready to go!
